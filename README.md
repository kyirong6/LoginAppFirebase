# LoginAppFirebase

The basic structure to setting up a quick register/login functionality to an app using firebase as a Baas.

##Functionalities:
* Register
* Login
* Reset Password
* Hashed Password

##### Added to this login functionality is Hashing the password through the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1). Unfortunately, everything done here is client side as the hashing would actually be done in the server side. Also, there is no salt being added to the hash value.
